          Believe it or not, copywriting is one of the most important
          content-creation skills a designer can possess. If you think about it,
          design exists to support and deliver content—not the other way around.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a designer, content should be the driving force behind many of your
          decisions, whether you’re creating a content or someone else is. So
          if you can understand how to write effective copy (and understand the
          purpose that it serves), you’ll be able to better serve your clients
          and ultimately create better designs.

          In this article, we’ll cover some helpful copywriting tips for
          designers to help you build better experiences.

          First things first, understand the nature of the copy you’re writing
          for. There are some subtle differences between sales (or persuasive)
          copywriting and UX writing.

          Sales copywriting is all about getting users to make a purchase or
          sign up for a product or service. UX copywriting, on the other hand,
          is all about helping users reach a goal efficiently and effectively.
